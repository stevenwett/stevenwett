								<h1>Gemini Memorial Designer</h1>
								<div className="title">Web App for Designing Bronze Plaques</div>
								<p className="date">Project launched in 2020</p>
								<p>Memorial Designer is a web app that I built for a client, Gemini, who is a signage manufacturer in the US. The app is for Gemini's customers in the monument builder industry and is within their <Link to="/ux-projects/gemini-partner-portal">Partner Portal</Link>. The purpose of the app is to let users quickly design and order bronze plaques for the memorials they build. I was the lead developer and designed and developed this app with co-workers and the client.</p>

									<h2>User Interviews</h2>
									<p>Starting the project, we thought we knew the needs of the end users, but wanted to validate our assumptions. My co-worker and I developed an interview guide and conducted six user interviews.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Two Gemini employees</li>
										<li>Four monument builders who will be using this product</li>
									</ul>
									<p>I analyzed the data we gather and used them to inform the prototypes.</p>

									<h2>User Testing</h2>
									<p>I conducted user tests with Gemini customers in the monument builder industry with a coworker. In these tests we instructed the users to create two different memorials using the Memorial Designer interactive designs. We asked that the users act as if we were a client and we gave them minimal instructions for how to complete the task. During this time, we recorded their comments and actions.</p>

										<li>Three monument builders who will be using this product</li>

									<p>I analyzed the results and made adjustments to the prototypes to solve common problems.</p>

									<h2>Designs</h2>
									<p>I created designs using Sketch for each of the views. For the designs I added color and more details to present a more finalized version for the client to react to and to save time when deciding on the overall look and feel of the app.</p>
									<p>I also designed the various PDFs that the user can download.</p>

									<h2>Development</h2>
									<h3>React / Redux Web App</h3>
									<p>Along with another developer, I built this app using a React/Redux architecture. Projects were saved to a MySQL database using custom endpoints via the WordPress REST API. The available options of this app are updatable in WordPress by the admin.</p>
									<h3>User Authentication</h3>
									<p>I developed a Firebase Auth integration that allowed for users to authenticate using an email and password, which gave them access to create projects and save them to their account. I built this integration using PHP and saved their logged in status using PHP Sessions.</p>
									<p>This authentication system served another purpose. The client had an upcoming project, the <Link to="/ux-projects/gemini-partner-portal">Partner Portal</Link>, that also required users to have accounts and so I developed it with the future project in mind. This auth system as of June 2022 is the backbone of their Partner Portal that has over 6,000 active users.</p>
									<h3>Web Accessibility</h3>
									<p>Web accessibility is very important to me and throughout this project I adhered to WCAG 2.0 AA standards. This means that I wrote HTML semantically, added ARIA labels when needed, made sure colors were properly contrasty and more.</p>
									<h3>Transactional emails</h3>
									<p>I integrated SendGridâ€™s PHP library and created an internal endpoint to send transactional emails to the user and to Gemini.</p>
									<h3>Quality assurance</h3>
									<p>To ensure that the product was reliable in all scenarios, I performed various forms of tests on this app. Tests include functionality testing, device/browser testing, and performance testing.</p>
