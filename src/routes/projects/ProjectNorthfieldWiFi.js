								<p>NorthfieldWiFi is an independent internet service provider (ISP) that supports rural communities with coverage in southern Minnesota and western Wisconsin. The clientâ€™s last website was clumsy for the end user and was overall a poor experience. A team member and I designed and created a new and simple website.</p>

									<h2>Understanding Priorities</h2>
									<p>The first step my team and I took for this project was to identify the business goals and the users who will be using the site. In this case, the major business goals were to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Get new customers to sign up, and to;</li>
										<li>Make it easy for existing customers to get support</li>
									</ul>
									<p>I created user personas for new and existing customers.</p>
